exmacaroons has a problem with rustler crates not working from the top level of an umbrella project

https://github.com/hansihe/rustler/pull/108/commits/571e69db4182d31ca4b0101ba979da208cdb6235

wondering how this actually works or if it just allows individual projects to compile but not at the umbrella level

this won't run unless placed back in the apps folder
